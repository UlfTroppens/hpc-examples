# hpc-examples
Small examples related to HPC

Most of the examples are documented as Jupyter Notebook. In general GitHub
renders Jupyter Notebooks nicely, but sometimes there is a temporary issue
with that function. In such situtations you can copy the notebook's URL to
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to render it properly.
